# Babble OCR


Babble OCR is a wrapper around the Pytesseract OCR module.  This program allows you to find specific predefined words within a photo.  Babble OCR implements the Levenshtein distance into the PyTesseract OCR platform and allows for a significant increase in OCR accuracy.

My specific use case was to find timestamp information for lyric videos on Youtube - I created this program to increase the accuracy in the method of OCR I was using.
